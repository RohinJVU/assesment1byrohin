First I decided to create a page about the EPL (English Premier League). The EPL is the largest and most competetive soccer league in the world. Within the
EPL, the Premier League created a gamemode in which fans of the sport can play and choose their players that participate within the Premier League in real 
life.

I decided to write about this game mode and inform users which players they should select, therefore referring to the page as the Fantasy Premier League
"Scout". 

I first decided to design the page with the header title as well as the background being blue resonating with the premier league brand. The page starts with
the header and proceeds with the body mentioning what users should expect within the page

Followed by the "Scout" which is referred to the author of the page, recommending three players users should look at for the upcoming gameweek to select 
in their fantasy premier league gameweek. 

Three players are recommended in bullet point code, mentioning the team they will be up against. The three players mentioned under the bullet points include,
Salah, Sterling and Toney.

Below that, each player's image is shown as well as the description on why they should be selected for the upcoming gameweek.

Once each player has been mentioned, I have redirected them to a link that will show more information on the actual premier league website.
